Our project focused on what water quality looks like throughout Georgia, with specific focuses on contamination metrics and the whether waterbodies in Georgia are meeting standards/policies put out. We also examined different socioeconomic factors affecting water quality, such as income and population density, to see if policies need to be introduced that address correlations between SES and water quality metrics.
